Each individual's personality is the culmination of his or her genetic makeup, biology, early life experiences, learning and culture. In this undergraduate-level course, we will review the major theories and research paradigms (e.g., trait, biological, cognitive) of modern-day personality psychology. The course will emphasize contemporary research, theory, and methodology, as well as provide a review of historical accounts that have significantly contributed to current conceptualizations.","groups":[[{"meta":{"number":1031,"type":"LEC","index":1},"meeting":{"pattern":"","timeStart":null,"timeEnd":null,"location":"","organizers":["Zayas, V"]},"credits":{"credits":"3"}}]]},{"code":4700,"title":"Undergraduate Research in Psychology","description":"Practice in planning, conducting, and reporting independent laboratory, field, and/or library research.","groups":[[{"meta":{"number":1050,"type":"IND","index":600},"meeting":{"pattern":"","timeStart":null,"timeEnd":null,"location":"","organizers":["Ophir, A"]},"credits":{"credits":"1-6"}},{"meta":{"number":1053,"type":"IND","index":601},"meeting":{"pattern":"","timeStart":null,"timeEnd":null,"location":"","organizers":["Casasola, M"]},"credits":{"credits":"1-6"}}]]}]},{"subject":"SOC","courses":[{"code":1101,"title":"Introduction to Sociology","description":"This course introduces classical and contemporary sociological perspectives.  We will begin by considering (mainly classical) perspectives which focus on macro-level features of society (e.g., population, the economy) and the sweeping changes that have occurred within them over the past couple of centuries.  Particular attention will be paid to changes in social cohesion, the division of labor, the spatial organization of society, and technology. These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","groups":[[{"meta":{"number":1045,"type":"LEC","index":1},"meeting":{"pattern":"","timeStart":null,"timeEnd":null,"location":"","organizers":["Sanyal, P"]},"credits":{"credits":"3"}}]]}]},{"subject":"STSCI","courses":[{"code":2100,"title":"Introductory Statistics","description":"Statistics is about understanding the world through data. We are surrounded by data, so there is a lot to understand. Covers data exploration and display, data gathering methods, probability, and statistical inference methods through contingency tables and linear regression. The emphasis is on thinking scientifically, understanding what is commonly done with data (and doing some of it for yourself), and laying a foundation for further study. Students learn to use statistical software and simulation tools to discover fundamental results. They use computers regularly; the test includes both multimedia materials and a software package. This course does not focus on data from any particular discipline, but will use real-world examples from a wide variety of disciplines and current events.","groups":[[{"meta":{"number":1035,"type":"LEC","index":1},"meeting":{"pattern":"","timeStart":null,"timeEnd":null,"location":"","organizers":["Gaynanova, I"]},"credits":{"credits":"4"}}]]}]},{"subject":"SYSEN","courses":[{"code":5700,"title":"Special Topics in Systems Engineering","description":"Supervised study by individuals or small groups of one or more specialized topics not covered in regular courses.","groups":[[{"meta":{"number":1051,"type":"IND","index":600},"meeting":{"pattern":"","timeStart":null,"timeEnd":null,"location":"","organizers":["Jackson, P"]},"credits":{"credits":"1-6"}}]]}]},{"subject":"VISST","courses":[{"code":4696,"title":"The Art Market","description":"This course will examine the history of the art market, from the 16th century to the present. We will study the production, sale and exchange of works of art as well as the patrons, artists and collectors who participate in this economic, social and political form of taste-making and aesthetic valuation. Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century. Using case studies, sample topics include: patterns of transportation, exchange and trade; the interaction of collectors, critics and curators; the spaces and contexts of display of contemporary collections; auction houses and commercial galleries; and fakes, forgeries, thefts and scandals. Special attention will be paid to considering the contemporary art market (post 1980) and the collecting, exchange and valuation of film, photography, painting, performance and installation art. Global markets for the exchange of art in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America will be highlighted as well as the exhibitions of contemporary art such as the Art Basel, the Cairo Biennale and the Venice Biennale that fuel these markets.","groups":[[{"meta":{"number":1008,"type":"SEM","index":100},"meeting":{"pattern":"","timeStart":null,"timeEnd":null,"location":"","organizers":["Finley, C"]},"credits":{"credits":"4"}}]]}]}]
