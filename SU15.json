The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future.",

Each section of the course focuses on a particular topic drawn from a range of fields (e.g., literature, history, film, music). Reading assignments are limited in order to allow ample time for discussion and for personal attention to student writing.",

Our writing practice is both \"creative\" and \"analytical.\" We discover how writers use drafting and revision as a process of thinking, and in weekly workshops we practice the kind of revision that can make us more independent as writers and more capable of giving helpful suggestions to friends who are also writers. The most important texts for the course are the essays of students enrolled in it; but we also read and discuss personal memoirs. This seminar offers students from diverse backgrounds a forum in which to move beyond accustomed boundaries, finding agency not only through use of the first-person voice but through increased confidence in their abilities as writers.",

The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future.",

      "description": "If you ever have thought that people of great achievement and ingenuity-such as great statesmen, artists, heroes, scientists-also exhibit a touch of madness, well, then you are not alone! Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as \"too different,\" as \"pathological,\" or as \"un-normal.\" You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States. Guest lecturers from various Humanities departments will expand our view on genius as either a human condition, an artistic invention or the delusive state of \"madness.\"",

In the second, we will consider two different lenses through which we might peer to evaluate policies. In the third, we will discuss the main lines of debate in contemporary American politics concerning four substantive issues: crime and punishment, education, the economy and foreign trade, and foreign policy.

This course seeks to answer these questions by exploring the history of modern Europe. Among other themes, we will discuss the Protestant Reformation, the rise of absolutism, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialism, colonialism, the Russian Revolution, the two world wars, decolonization and immigration, May '68, and the construction of the European Union. In conjunction, we will examine how modern ideologies (liberalism, Marxism, imperialism, conservatism, fascism, totalitarianism) were developed and challenged. Through a wide array of historical documents (fiction, letters, philosophy, treatises, manifestos, films, and art), we will consider why \"old Europe\" is still relevant for us today.",

They have been the longest wars in American history and have ended amid much ambivalence about the US engagement in each place and the results. They are part of a series of wars that America has fought as a global power, with a global reach, sending its forces thousands of miles from home. That global reach is not new, and goes back all the way to 1898 and the Spanish-American War. This course will look at the American military experience from our first tentative steps onto the global stage in 1898, to the earth-spanning conflicts of World War I and II, to the nuclear tension of Cold War conflicts, and finish with the current Long War against terrorism, and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.",

We develop critical resources to better understand the history of these new technologies and communicative forms, the economics behind them, the policies developing around them, and the sociocultural shifts from which they have emerged, and that they have helped provoke. We will aim to discard commonplace assumptions about these tools and phenomena, to ask deeper questions about their impact on society.",

Topics include examination of the ways in which class relates to social and public space and urban space as performance. Additional course work in film production, performance, and writing allows students to re-inscribe their spatial/corporeal experiences into an alternative exhibition space of the city street or the written page. In addition, each student will be required to produce formal textual documentation and full textual analyses of this process and final performance, installation, or text-based product.",

A substantial part of this course involves partial differential equations, such as the heat equation, the wave equation, and Laplace's equation. (This part must be present in any outside course being considered for transfer credit to Cornell as a substitute for MATH 2930.)",

These meetings are used to present information on international business conditions, industrial structures, management styles, and also to develop cross-cultural skills. Students also must attend one post-trip meeting with a discussion and analysis of their impressions from the trip. A final paper, integrating the material learned in the classroom with their experiences, is required.",

Salsa, arguably the most popular social dance in the world, derives from the Cuban rhythm of Son, while it grew to world fame through its growth in New York City and Puerto Rico. The development of Salsa as a dance form follows its development as a musical genre. Bachata and Merengue, meanwhile, are considered quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is Cuban Carnival line dance. In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of dance foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection, and space use. Class begins with a stretching and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance steps and movement patterns across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle, and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you will improve in the others. Dancing with live percussion at one or more of our classes will help connect the dots of timing, rhythm and motion. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and pick up other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free. Each student is free to learn the lead or follow role.",

Recall the excitement and your sense of adventure when you first crawled into the branches to look inside a bird's nest. Then you swung from limb to limb without a thought of ropes and harnesses. But what about that big tree down the street you always wanted to climb, but couldn't reach the first branch? Cornell Outdoor Education's Tree Climbing course will teach you how to get up into the canopy of any tree, to move around, even to climb from one tree to another without touching the ground. This course will teach you how to use ropes and technical climbing gear to reach the top of any tree, to move around, and even to climb from tree to tree without returning to the ground. All equipment is included in the course fee.",

The class will consider traditional tools of political and social satire, including Commedia dellArte.  Fundamental in commedia is the exploration of status, the gradation of power and influence and role-playing. Students will create their own texts and movement as well as draw from other textual and visual sources. The class will conclude with a public performance.",

Topics include examination of the ways in which class relates to social and public space and urban space as performance. Additional course work in film production, performance, and writing allows students to re-inscribe their spatial/corporeal experiences into an alternative exhibition space of the city street or the written page. In addition, each student will be required to produce formal textual documentation and full textual analyses of this process and final performance, installation, or text-based product.",

Humans are a social species and our connection to others is a core element of our experience. The course will examine how and why different people act differently in the same situation, sometimes as a result of the culture in which they were raised, the family in which they grew up, or the genetic make-up they inherited. The course will also examine how and why different situations, especially social situations, channel behavior in particular directions, minimizing and overcoming differences between individuals. In discussing these themes, the course will address such questions as: Why do we hold stereotypes? How do we decide what motivates other people's actions? How are beliefs and attitudes formed and changed? How do invisible social norms influence our behavior? What factors determine whom we like and love? What is the nature of emotional experience? Why are people capable of great cruelty and inspiring altruism? Along the way, students will learn how these questions can be scientifically studied, so that our knowledge of human behavior can rest on a solid foundation and go beyond the speculations offered by philosophers, poets, and other astute observers for millennia.",

These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.",

Through a series of key literary works, films, and other visual representations we will explore such topics as the place of tradition, religion, and the family in modern Spain. Our focus will be on the transformation of Spain from an authoritarian state under General Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975) into a remarkably diverse and pluralistic nation in which linguistic, cultural, political, and gender differences have been consecrated in a very progressive legislation. This course satisfies the main requirement for the minor in Spanish, may be used as an elective for the major, and is crucial to those planning to study abroad in Spain in the near future.",

The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future.",

The class will consider traditional tools of political and social satire, including Commedia dellArte.  Fundamental in commedia is the exploration of status, the gradation of power and influence and role-playing. Students will create their own texts and movement as well as draw from other textual and visual sources. The class will conclude with a public performance.",

Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century. Using case studies, sample topics include: patterns of transportation, exchange and trade; the interaction of collectors, critics and curators; the spaces and contexts of display of contemporary collections; auction houses and commercial galleries; and fakes, forgeries, thefts and scandals. Special attention will be paid to considering the contemporary art market (post 1980) and the collecting, exchange and valuation of film, photography, painting, performance and installation art. Global markets for the exchange of art in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America will be highlighted as well as the exhibitions of contemporary art such as the Art Basel, the Cairo Biennale and the Venice Biennale that fuel these markets.",

The focus of this clinical rotation will be the development of a knowledge base and a comprehensive set of skills necessary for a veterinarian to perform adequately in these areas, within a structured format. These skills include the appropriate evaluation (triage) and stabilization of emergency patients, the management of postoperative and other critical patients, and sensitive and effective client communication. Participants access relevant information fromvarious sources related to emergency and critical care medicine and understand and apply these principles to clinical cases. Students will participate in the management of incoming emergency cases as well as have primary patient care responsibilities in both intensive care and intermediate care units. Students will work closely with interns, residents, technicians and faculty on the Emergency & Critical Care Service to become familiar with technical and nursing procedures as well as to develop clinical skills and a systematic approach to clinical cases.",

Ambulatory students typically do qualitative and quantitative flotations on samples from large-animal cases they have encountered that week. In CPS, one hour is spent testing samples from current dog and cat patients, while a second hour is devoted to a discussion of the treatment of common endo- and ecto-parasites. Pathology students typically examine and identify intact parasites they retrieve from various organs at necropsy. This course is considered to be a logical extension of Foundation Course IV: Host, Agent, and Defense, and is expected to build on the didactic material presented in Large- and Small-Animal Parasitology.",

Having a solid comfort level with neurologic examinations and neurolocalization is essential, as neurologic diseases are common in practice. This course will provide experience with examinations, neurolocalization and clinical management of intracranial, spinal, and neuromuscular disease. Students will take part in all aspects of case management, by initially shadowing senior students, then functioning more independently as they gain more confidence, while under close supervision of residents and the Chief on duty. This will include practice with clinical histories, examination, neurolocalization, medical records, and treatments. Students will also participate in clinical and didactic teaching rounds.  Management, diagnostic, and treatment options for use in general and referral practices will be discussed.",
